# Assignment-5

## Description

This repository contains two basic Python programs demonstrating dictionary operations and list slicing concepts.

📌 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
🔍 Description
This program creates a dictionary where student names are used as keys and their marks as values. It allows the user to input a student's name and retrieves the corresponding marks. If the entered name is not found in the dictionary, the program displays an appropriate message.

📚 Concepts Covered
Dictionary creation and access

User input handling

Conditional logic using if-else statements

Error handling for missing keys

💡 Use Case
Useful for understanding basic dictionary operations and conditional branching in Python.

📌 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
🔍 Description
This program showcases list slicing techniques in Python. It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements, reverses the extracted list, and prints all three versions (original, extracted, reversed).

📚 Concepts Covered
List creation with range()

List slicing and indexing

Reversing a list using slicing

Output formatting with print()

💡 Use Case
Ideal for beginners learning list manipulation and slicing operations in Python.
